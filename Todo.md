**Ordered task list:**

**Critical updates:**

**Simple tasks not necessary for MVP:**

- Integrate round-robin brackets into software.

- Highlight the winner on the display brackets page.
- When a bout is edited, the component should rerender (on the display brackets page).
- When a bout is dispatched to a mat, the component should rerender (on the display brackets page).
- Customer screen should look different than staff screen for matside table.
- Adding competitors should cause a rerender of the component
- Adding a new event should trigger a rerender
- Adding a new division should trigger a rerender
- Why do we need to click "remove byes" so many times? 1 time should be enough.

**More complex tasks that are not necessary for MVP:**

- All bouts in a division need to be displayed properly (formatted like a bracket)
- Make it so that it is not hardcoded into a 32 man bracket, but that it automatically makes the properly sized brackets.
- Text notifications
