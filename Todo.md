- All bouts in a division need to be displayed properly (formatted like a bracket)

- Make it so that it is not hardcoded into a 32 man bracket, but that it automatically makes the properly sized brackets.

- Hardcoded brackets do not have the correct match order. I have since figured out that after the first round, it should go to a championship round, followed by 2 rounds of wrestlebacks, then the pattern repeats.
